You are a computer science professor at Your Favorite University, and
are in dire need of automatic grading! The good news is you have all of
your student's assignments in an easy-to-read format, making automation easy!

For each class you teach, you have your grades in a CSV file that contains
the student name followed by the grade for each assignment. These files are
located in the `classes` directory. All assignments are based on 100 points
and are scored in whole numbers. All students have received the same number
of assignments.

Your task is to produce a grade file for each class. The first line of the
class grade file should contain the class average. Each additional line
should contain the student name and their class average separated by a comma.
The grade files should also be located in the `classes` directory and be
named similarly, e.g. class_X_grade_averages.txt.
